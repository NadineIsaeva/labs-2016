    <p class="desc">One beautiful cream-point male birman kitten for sale. I'm looking for a loving new pet home for this gorgeous, playful yet affectionate boy. He is from a litter of three of which two have been reserved. They have been raised in a family home around children, other cats and a dog. Their mum is our family pet and is available to see also. They will go to their new homes fully vaccinated, micro-chipped, wormed, flea treated and with four weeks free pet insurance. They will also have a four generation pedigree and be gccf registered.</p>
