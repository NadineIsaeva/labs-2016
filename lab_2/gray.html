    <p class="desc">We have available a lovely British Shorthair Blue Girl.
She is GCCF ACTIVE registered and has had a fabulous litter of kittens for us earlier this year.
Sadly we are having to sell our cats due to buying a house abroad.

We bred her and kept her back as she was so pretty, she has a superb pedigree.
She is an indoor cat, and has always been indoors.
She is very pretty, she is a beautiful Blue, and has a lovely temperament. 

She is only 18 months old, so has plenty of potential as a breeding queen.
If you think she could be for you get in touch.
Please email first as phone reception here is very poor.</p>
